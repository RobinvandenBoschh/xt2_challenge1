# xt2_challenge1
 This is the first assignment for the XT2 course

I would like to start with this inspirational quote from 1986: 
    "In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove,
    And from this groove came the groove of all grooves,
    And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldy declared,
    'Let there be HOUSE!'
    and house music was born."



With that said, I would like to start with this:
    Please don't sue me   :)
    I've tried to use only royalty free images, apart from the SpaceX logo. 
    I don't own the rights to the SpaceX logo, or any other content I've used from their website.
    This website and all its content is for a school assignment and isn't in any way used for any commercial purposes.
    Last but not least, I am just a poor student and therfore I can't really afford any accusations    :)
    


Most of the lines have a comment written in Dutch, in which is explained what the choices were behind he usage of that line. 
    If you don't speak Dutch... well, erm, you could perhaps try Google Translate. Good luck with that. 
    Otherwise, I am sorry.
